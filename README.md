# Ninjam JS

Music collaboration in the browser!

## Overview

NINJAM is a client/server software originally released in 2005 as a way for
musicians to collaborate (by jamming!) over the Internet.

Ninjam JS is built using web technologies (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) and acts as a
NINJAM client, connecting to servers just like the official C++ client. It can
run as a standalone application using Node-WebKit, as a Chrome App, or (almost)
as a packaged app for Firefox OS.

## Development Status

Ninjam JS is still a work in progress. The current code is capable of
connecting to servers, sending and receiving chat messages (including votes),
and listening to audio channels from other users. Recording and uploading of
audio is coming soon.

You can install a work-in-progress build using Chrome, Chromium, or Chrome OS
