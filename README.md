# Ninjam JS

Music collaboration in the browser!

## Overview

NINJAM is a client/server software originally released in 2005 as a way for
musicians to collaborate (by jamming!) over the Internet.

Ninjam JS is a Chrome Application, written in JavaScript, which acts as a
NINJAM client and can connect to Ninjam servers, much like the official client.

Ninjam JS is currently in development, but keep an eye on this repository -- 
beta releases should be available sometime soon!

## Development Status

Ninjam JS is still a work in progress. The current code is capable of
connecting to servers, sending and receiving chat messages (and votes), and
(to a slightly buggy degree) listening to audio from other users.
